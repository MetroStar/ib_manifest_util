# Contributing to the Iron Bank Manifest Utility

Welcome 👋🏼!

Thanks for being interested in contributing to the Iron Bank Manifest Utility (IB Manifest). We’re glad you want to join this community!
The IB Manifest team truly believes that everyone belongs in open source, and we are dedicated to making you feel welcome.

All contributions are welcome, including issues, contributing code, new docs as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, helping out people, organizing community events, working on accessibility and design items, and more. By contributing to open source projects you can connect with people, learn new skills, become a subject-matter expert, and apply all learnings to your own projects.
